# Milestones
> This file lays out a general timeline that you can follow to gauge your progress on P1. 

> We can break our project down into smaller MVPs in order to make it more manageable. 
> As a first part to project 1, we will build a console-based application (interaction in IntelliJ's console collecting user input) without a front end. 

## By the beginning / middle of Week 3
- Some progress on business logic and console interaction using the Scanner Class
- Implement methods from the P1 Skeleton
  - with some tests passing

## By the end of Week 3 / Beginning of Week 4
- Console user interaction done
- Database persistence done (your console-based application is successfully saving data to a database).

## By the end of Week 4 
- Application is connected to AWS RDS Database and data is persisted
- Back end is complete with Servlets
- Some progress made on html for front end
  - no JavaScript yet, but can have place holders (buttons/tables)

## By the middle of Week 5
